# About Jeremy Giovannetti

## Snapshot
Name: Jeremy Giovannetti
Experience: Senior/Lead-level product design on a range of diverse domains. Led the end to end product design process from research to launch. and design leadership roles
Background:  Over 6 years of experience product/UI/UX design experience, 10+ years as a creative 

Identity as a professional: Product/UX designer and creative leader who ships quickly, iterates fast, and enjoys complex, constraint-heavy problems. Enjoys solving complex problems with talented teams.
Wants to join a team that values growth, and solving meaningful problems, wants to be a part of team that he can continue to learn from.
Style: Concise, practical, detail-oriented; values speed with quality, strong cross-functional collaboration, and measurable outcomes.

## Values and Design Philosophy NOTE FOR CLAUDE: DO NOT REPHRASE THIS ONE, but only this section.
- Super fast, super clear: The product development cycle is undergoing a transformative shift. With more volocity, clarity becomes paramount.
- The right problem first: Speed is our advantage, but we need to ensure we are not running in the wrong direction. Epecially when it comes to core functionality or critical user flows.
- Say it loud when it can't speak for itself: I believe proactive communication is a part of what makes a great designer. So much of what we do is communication, so we should be handing off designs that speak for themselves, and collaborating closely when they don't. I personally believe a most of the time this means in person.
- Growth, forever: Learning never stops, especially now. As tools evolve at unprecidented rates, I believe teams must invest in education and training like never before. If not, they risk struggling to keep up, fall behind, and become irrelevant at an equally unprecidented rate.


## Professional Background
- Roles held: Design Director; Product Designer; UX Design Lead; Design Director; Artist/Project Manager.
- In his career, he has led initiatives like developing a UX playbook that standardized organizational UX practices by clarifying logistics, timelines, use cases, and feasibility. He spearheaded the building of an organizational design system that increased design and design to dev efficiency, resulting in Primitive offering an additional service line for lower budget clients utilizing that design system. He has built workshop frameworks both for the client side as a part of an onboarding process to build alignment and also to understand what their needs are more. That resulted in a 100% workshop to retainer conversion rate at launch and also resulted in a 24% larger client retainer largely due to increased trust and the building of a good relationship between the client and Primitive and the team through those workshops. He also built internal workshops and facilitates workshops to grow design teams, to find the right problems, iterate appropriately, conduct design reviews, and to just have fun.

Note for ChatGPT: USE THIS AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE WAY JEREMY COMMUNICATES:
So, my name is Jeremy. I really see myself as a very passionate, empathetic person. I'm very supportive, and I believe that's the reason why I've been kind of offered some of these leadership opportunities sooner in my career than others might. I learn very quickly. I'm always – I seek to always be growing. I try to push myself. I like doing hard things. I really – I'm just someone that cares deeply about his craft. I'm somebody that believes in the work. I want to be on a team where I'm surrounded by great humans that also feel the same way, that we are very realistic about this is a job, and it's a job. But if we're not passionate about what we're doing, and if we're not good people to one another, then what's the point? So, I think what's a lot bigger for me is – at the end of it is like the kindness we show each other and who we are towards one another, especially when things get hard. And so – and also being able to do the hard things. Not always the easy thing, but seeking to just be kind, like recklessly kind is something that's important to me.

## Personal Interests and Lifestyle
- Lifestyle: Outdoor‑oriented; athlete mindset and training, running.
