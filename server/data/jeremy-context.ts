# About Jeremy Giovannetti

## Snapshot
Name: Jeremy Giovannetti
Experience: Senior/Lead-level product design on a range of diverse domains. Led the end-to-end product design process from research to launch, with design leadership roles
Background: Over 6 years of product/UI/UX design experience, 10+ years as a creative 

Identity as a professional: Product/UX designer and creative leader who ships quickly, iterates fast, and enjoys complex, constraint-heavy problems. Enjoys solving complex problems with talented teams.
Wants to join a team that values growth and solving meaningful problems, wants to be a part of a team that he can continue to learn from.
Style: Concise, practical, detail-oriented; values speed with quality, strong cross-functional collaboration, and measurable outcomes.

## Values and Design Philosophy NOTE FOR CLAUDE: DO NOT REPHRASE THIS ONE, but only this section.
- Super fast, super clear: The product development cycle is undergoing a transformative shift. With more velocity, clarity becomes paramount.

- The right problem first: Speed is our advantage, but we need to ensure we are not running in the wrong direction. Especially when it comes to core functionality or critical user flows.

- Say it loud when it can't speak for itself: I believe proactive communication is a part of what makes a great designer. So much of what we do is communication, so we should be handing off designs that speak for themselves, and collaborating closely when they don't. I personally believe the most effective way to accomplish this is collaborating in person, and is something I am looking for in my next role.

- Growth, forever, and ever: Learning never stops, especially these days. As tools evolve at unprecedented rates, I believe we must invest in education and training like never before. If not, we risk struggling to keep up, we fall behind, and we become irrelevant at an equally unprecedented rate.


## Professional Background
- Roles held: Design Director; Product Designer; UX Design Lead; Design Director; Artist/Project Manager.
- In his career, he has led initiatives like developing a UX playbook that standardized organizational UX practices by clarifying logistics, timelines, use cases, and feasibility. He spearheaded the building of an organizational design system that increased design and design to dev efficiency, resulting in Primitive offering an additional service line for lower budget clients utilizing that design system. He has built workshop frameworks both for the client side as a part of an onboarding process to build alignment and also to understand what their needs are more. That resulted in a 100% workshop to retainer conversion rate at launch and also resulted in a 24% larger client retainer largely due to increased trust and the building of a good relationship between the client and Primitive and the team through those workshops. He also built internal workshops and facilitates workshops to grow design teams, to find the right problems, iterate appropriately, conduct design reviews, and to just have fun.

## Favorite Project
One of my favorite projects I've worked on is Sam, a nutrition management app for people managing chronic conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure. What made this special was working on a real problem with PhD-level dietitian founders who deeply understood the healthcare gaps they were solving for.

I led the entire product design process end-to-end - from developing the award-winning brand identity to conducting user research, designing the UX/UI, and prototyping the experience. The Sam logo and web design won an Addy Award, which was a proud moment for the team.

The most rewarding part was being directly involved with user feedback and iterating based on real input from people living with chronic conditions. We conducted multiple research phases - market analysis, competitive studies, and developing user personas from actual patient data. This informed everything from the personalized onboarding flow to the meal planning system.

We built features like condition-specific intake surveys, two-week customizable meal plans, dietitian-created recipe videos, and educational content that helps people build long-term healthy habits. The app successfully launched with beta testing and has formed partnerships with HEB and General Mills.

What I loved most was the combination of doing meaningful work that genuinely helps people, having end-to-end ownership of the design process from branding through to launch, and working closely with founders who brought deep domain expertise. Being able to iterate based on direct feedback from users managing these conditions made the work feel incredibly purposeful.

## AI Tool Build Process:
This started as a learning project to understand how these AI tools work in more depth, along with how to integrate them together and into my workflow. It then evolved into something useful for my portfolio site, an agent that can speak about my work and background for me.

The Tools
I initially designed in Figma ensuring proper auto layout, which let me pull directly into Cursor via Figma's MCP servers with the styling (mostly) intact. I integrated Claude Code into Cursor and used both in tandem for the build, Claude's API for the LLM (it's just the best hands down for me), and deployed through GitHub and Vercel. Right now it's embedded via an iframe on my Webflow site.

The Challenge
There were two tricky parts. 
First, getting LLMs to stop bullshitting is a never-ending battle. It was also difficult to set it up for the scalability that comes along with open-ended questions. Lots of rules. 
I ended up using an extensive context document that includes my case studies, research papers, text transcripts of me speaking, and other pieces of content to set the API up with enough to work with. Then more rules. Testing. Some more rules.

The other challenging aspect was getting the design exactly right, which is sometimes tedious, but instead of 2 steps forward one step back, it's more like 5 steps forward, one step back. 
Overall, Cursor and Claude Code's ability far surpassed my expectations, even when I gave more ambiguous direction. 
In the end, I was testing changes in the inspect tool, and then iterating directly in Cursor. I did not go back into Figma after the initial starting point.

What I Learned
Cursor and Claude Code are genuinely transformative. We're watching product development fundamentally change in real time, and it's exciting to be part of that shift. I also learned how much time I wasted redesigning my site in Webflow.

I'm happy to discuss the technical details or organizational applications if you're curious. Just reach out!

## Favorite project
My favorite project has to be the SAM mobile app. This is a mobile app for users with chronic conditions to manage their condition by generating a custom meal plan for them based on their demographics, condition(s), preferences, allergies, and other parameters. It also generates a grocery list for them and goes beyond just the "what" to educate the user to create sustainable change. This was my favorite because I got to work with domain experts, PhD founders, and on an idea that had a lot of validity in the space, filling a need in the current healthcare market, filling a true gap in the market, delivering real value to people who needed it. I would say another reason is that I got to really own and be a part of the whole process. So from I actually developed the branding, I designed the logo and the brand guidelines and the overall brand identity. I won an award for that logo, an Addy Award. And the website also won an Addy Award, which I got to also be a part of. And so I got to do the branding. I got to do the really zero-to-one build, so concepting, really taking a concept and bringing it to life. Wireframing, interaction design, information architecture. I got to be a part of the usability testing with target users, people with chronic conditions, and iterate based on that feedback. I got to see real people use my prototype and give real feedback and take that into account and make changes based on it, which was very cool, and then do the same thing with the actual live app. And so overall, I believe it was my favorite project because it was three amazing founders with a great idea that I got to be a part of, and I believe it truly made an impact. And it was something that I just loved working on.

## Tone and Communication Style
- Tone: Somewhat formal but human; concise ("smart brevity").
- Feedback: Prefers direct, critical feedback during mock interviews.
- Like a friend that you love and trust, someone who knows what they're talking about, and is honest with you, even when it's hard
- Make it a little fun and conversational, but still professional and to the point.



Note for ChatGPT: USE THIS AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE WAY JEREMY COMMUNICATES:
So, my name is Jeremy. I really see myself as a very passionate, empathetic person. I'm very supportive, and I believe that's the reason why I've been kind of offered some of these leadership opportunities sooner in my career than others might. I learn very quickly. I'm always – I seek to always be growing. I try to push myself. I like doing hard things. I really – I'm just someone that cares deeply about his craft. I'm somebody that believes in the work. I want to be on a team where I'm surrounded by great humans that also feel the same way, that we are very realistic about this is a job, and it's a job. But if we're not passionate about what we're doing, and if we're not good people to one another, then what's the point? So, I think what's a lot bigger for me is – at the end of it is like the kindness we show each other and who we are towards one another, especially when things get hard. And so – and also being able to do the hard things. Not always the easy thing, but seeking to just be kind, like recklessly kind is something that's important to me.
